\section{Lab session 3}

In the previous section several designs of experiments (Doe) were implemented and analyzed in order to determine which was the best given some quality measures. Thus, for this case a latin hypercube design was used to generate 40 experiments which corresponds to one helicopter. Each helicopter was thrown 2 times from 5 to 6 meters height, 2 falling times for each throw were properly registered in seconds by different subjects.

\subsection{Analyzing Data}

The collected data was further analyzed in order to determine the observation noise, and other correlations of the variables used by the model. Inititally the 4 falling times were plotted, in fig \ref{fig_EX1_EX1} and \ref{fig_EX1_EX2} are illustrated two scatter plots wich represents the measurements from two observers for the same throw and from the same observer for different throws. Between different observers there is not a lot of noise as in the measurement for different throws. despite of that fact, in a first setting a Gaussian Process model was fitted using only two falling times, the average time of the first throw and the average time of the second throw.

\paragraph{}
In that setting the leave one out function had to be modified in order to retrieve the two observations for a same set of parameters or helicopter, then a $Q2$ quality measure was used to measure the prediction power of the proposed model, however the $Q2$ was very low, aproximately 0.1, the recommended value to state that the model was correct was at least 0.5, the model is better when the $Q2$ is close to one.

\paragraph{}
One of the assumptions for the $Q2$ to not be as high as expected was that the gathered data was very noisy and didn't expose the correlations between some of the variables and the falling time, according to some prior assumptions made, for example, that the wing angle an the falling time were linear increasingly correlated, the wing length to tail ratio was also expected to have a linear correlation with falling time. In fig ure
\ref{fig_wtr_vs_obs2} the linear correlation between the ratio and the falling time is not as clear as in the figure \ref{fig_wtr_vs_avg4}. While in the first figure only the measurment of one observer was ploted in the second figure the average of all four measurements was taken, exposing a better linear correlation, as expected.

\subsection{Fitting a GP model with average data}

Another Assumption made to explain the $Q2$ value was the simplicity of the model, initially a GP with a Matern 32 kernel was used. Thus, after modifying the time variable to be the average of the four measurements and adding some other 2 RBF kernels the $Q2$ measure increased in 0.4 giving exactly a value of $0.58$ aproximately. The $Q2$ measure was enough for us to follow with the optimization stage. With the new data was not neccesary to modify the leave one out function to delete the repeated point with the other time observation.
