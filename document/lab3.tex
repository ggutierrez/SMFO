\section{Lab session 3}

The latin latin hypercube method was used to generate $40$ models of the
helicopter experiment. Each helicopter was thrown $2$ times from $5$ to $6$
meters height. Two falling times for each throw were registered in seconds by
different observers.

\subsection{Analyzing Data}

The collected data was further analyzed to inspect the observation noise and
possible correlations among the model variables. \Cref{fig_EX1_EX1,fig_EX1_EX2}
presents the correlations between the falling times registered by the two
observers for every throw. There is no much noise between the observers of each
throw. However there is considerable noise between the different throws. Despite
of that, in a first setting a Gaussian Process model was fitted using only two
falling times corresponding to the average times of the two throws.

In that setting the leave one out function had to be modified in order to
retrieve the two observations for the same set of parameters. The power
prediction of the model was computed by a $Q2$ quality measure. The result was
around $0.1$ which is pretty bad as the value should be above $0.5$ and is
better when close to $1.0$.

The conclusion on the obtained value for $Q2$  was that the gathered data was
very noisy and did not expose the correlations between the model variables and
the falling time. Some prior conclusions from a former lab exposed an increasing
linear correlation between the wing angle and the falling time. This kind of
correlation was also present with the wing length to tail ratio.
In~\cref{fig_wtr_vs_obs2} the linear correlation between the ratio and the
falling time is not as clear as in~\cref{fig_wtr_vs_avg4}. While in the first
figure only the measurement of one observer was plotted in the second figure the
average of all four measurements was taken, exposing a better correlation, as
expected.

\subsection{Fitting a GP model with the average}

Another Assumption made to explain the $Q2$ value was the simplicity of the
model, initially a GP with a Matern32 kernel was used. Thus, after modifying
the time variable to be the average of the four measurements and adding some
other 2 RBF kernels the $Q2$ measure increased in 0.4 giving exactly a value of
$0.58$ approximately. The $Q2$ measure was enough for us to follow with the
optimization stage. With the new data was not necessary to modify the leave one
out function to delete the repeated point with the other time observation. In
the figure \ref{mloo_vs_real} a plot is made showing the real falling times
against the GP predictions, following a linear tendency which also is an
evidence that the model is suitable to make predictions.

\paragraph{}
For further model validation the standardized residuals of the leave one out
predictions where also computed and plotted against the mean predicted
value(standardized for this case), the plot shows something not very similar to
a linear tendency according to a normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ as will
be expected for better fitted models.
