\section{Lab session 2}

In this lab the design of experiments was implemented in order to generate the
initial helicopter data set in order to measure several falling times. The idea
was to define a design of experiment (DoE) which the best filling space
properties.

\subsection{Choosing the best design of experiment}
Filling space properties for a DoE were measured using several measures that
were defined and explained in the lecture sessions as follows:

\begin{description}
	\item[Maximin:] The minimum distance between two points should be large, then
	the larger the measure the better the DoE is.

	\item[Minmax:] The maximum distance between any point in the space and a point
	in DoE should be small, then, the smaller the measure the better the DoE is.

	\item[Discrepancy:] The less the discrepancy the better the design of
	experiment, converging to the uniform distribution.
\end{description}

For the case it was necessary to program methods to generate experiments, The
\emph{Latin Hypercube} and the \emph{Kmeans}, both these methods were compared
with a random sample using the discrepancy measures and some plots.
\Cref{tab:doe_eval} presents the quality evaluation for each DoE. For our
setting, the latin hypercube exhibited the best behavior, being the second best
one for all the criteria, even though the random method is the best evaluated by
discrepancy and \emph{maximin}, in \emph{minimax} is the worst one.

Kmeans outperforms the Latin hypercube method using the minimax criteria, even
though if one takes a look at the projections of the points on some variables
the points distribute as showed in~\cref{fig_wl_vs_ww_lhd,fig_wl_vs_ww_kmeans},
this plots show that the latin hypercube has better projection capacity that the
kmeans for our setting. Thus, the Latin hypercube was chosen as the DoE.

After this process it was necessary to transform the DoE to the printing space in which it had to fulfill several constraints to be printed.
