\section{Lab session 2}

In this lab we applied the theory behind the design of experiments (DoE) to
generate an appropriate data set of helicopter models and measure the resulting
falling times for them. The objective was to experiment with models properly
filling the filling space properties.

\paragraph{Choosing the best design of experiment.} Filling space properties for
a DoE were measured using several measures that were defined and explained in
the lecture sessions as follows:

\begin{description}
	\item[MaxiMin:] The minimum distance between two points should be large, then
	the larger the measure the better the DoE.

	\item[MiniMax:] The maximum distance between any point in the space and a point
	in DoE should be small, hence, the smaller the measure the better the DoE.

	\item[Discrepancy:] The less the discrepancy the better the DoE, converging to
	the uniform distribution.
\end{description}

The methods for using \emph{latin hypercube} and \emph{k-means} were implemented
to generate the experiments. Their results were compared with a random sampling
using discrepancy methods and visual inspection. \Cref{tab:doe_eval} presents
the quality evaluation for each DoE. For our setting, the latin hypercube
exhibited the best behavior ranking on the second place for all the criteria.
The random approach obtained the best evaluations on discrepancy and
\emph{MaxiMin} but got the worst rank for \emph{MiniMax}.

K-means outperforms the latin hypercube method on the MiniMax criterion.
However, according to~~\cref{fig_wl_vs_ww_lhd,fig_wl_vs_ww_kmeans}, latin
hypercube has a better projection capacity than k-means. In consequence  we
chose the latin hypercube as the method for the DoE.

After this process it was necessary to transform the DoE to the printing space
in which it had to fulfill several constraints to be printed.
