\subsection{Linear regression}
For this part we were asked to analyze the data corresponding to two
realizations of the helicopter experiment.

\paragraph{Noise between realizations of the experiment.}

\Cref{fig_t1t2} shows the plot between the times of the experiments for every
realization. The average variance between the time of the experiments is
\SI{0.0425}{\second}. This indicates that there is not much noise present in the
data.

    \label{fig_tl_al}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Relations in the input data.}
According to the provided data, we can appreciate some relation between
different variables. For instance, the wing length and the falling times seems
to be linearly correlated according to~\cref{fig_wl_times}. The same correlation
but this time less clear is present in~\cref{fig_al_times} with the arm length.
Finally, the arm and tail lengths might also be correlated as shown
in~\cref{fig_tl_al}.
\begin{figure}

  \input{../lab1/wing_length_vs_times.pgf}
  \caption{Correlation between the wing length (in centimeters) and the falling
  times (in seconds) of the two realizations.}
  \label{fig_wl_times}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{../lab1/arm_length_vs_times.pgf}
  \caption{Correlation between the arm length (in centimeters) and the falling
  times (in seconds) of the two realizations.}
  \label{fig_al_times}
\end{figure}

Despite of the described relations among the different variables, there are no
strong correlations among the variables of the model. Linear correlations are
just apparent but not clearly strong.

\paragraph{Linear regression.} A first model $m(X)$ was approximated by using a
linear regression. The basis functions were $\phi(x) = [1, x_0, x_0^2]$. Those
functions were based on effects on the wing length ($x_0$). However, the
coefficient of determination ($R^2$) for the obtained model was $0.237$. A
better model is obtained using the basis functions $\phi(x) = [1, x, x_3^2,
\sin(x_3), \cos(x_0)]$. $R^2$  for the new model is $0.778$ which (graphically)
fits better the data according to~\cref{fig_goodlr}.

  \end{figure}
\end{comment}
Several functions were tried as basis. The ones with more effect are the
constant function ($1$), the linear effect on all the variables ($x$), the
cosine effect on the wing length ($\cos(x_0)$). However the other functions also
contribute to improve $R^2$.

\subsection{Gaussian process regression}

\paragraph{Kernel names.} In the first point we are presented a several kernel
implementations and asked to identify them. The first two implementations are
actually the same and both represent the \emph{Matern32} kernel. The third is
the implementation of the constant kernel. The fourth implementation is for the
\emph{Brownian} kernel. The last implementation corresponds to the
\emph{Gaussian} kernel.

\paragraph{Sampling from a Gaussian process and plots.}
The sampling function is completed by evaluating the provided kernel on the
input data. After that $n$ random samples are taken from a multivariate normal
with the provided mean ($\mu$) and the kernel as the covariance parameter.
\Cref{fig_gpsamples} presents samplings of the same kernel with different
parameters. The plot on the left uses $\theta=0.8$ which leads to a wider
``waves''.

    \caption{Sample from a Gaussian process with kernel evaluated using the wing
    length of the helicopter. The kernel for the left sampling of five functions
    is \emph{Matern32} with $\sigma^2=1.0$ and $\theta=0.2$. The second plot is
    the same kernel, this time with only three functions and $\theta=0.8$}
