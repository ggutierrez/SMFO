\subsection{Linear regression}
For this part we were asked to analyze the data corresponding to two
realizations of the helicopter experiment.

\paragraph{Noise between realizations of the experiment.}

\Cref{fig_t1t2} shows the plot between the times of the experiments for every
realization. The average variance between the time of the experiments is
\SI{0.0425}{\second}. This indicates that there is not much noise present in the
data.

    \caption{Comparison between the tail and the arm lengths.}
    \label{fig_tl_al}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Relations in the input data.}
According to the provided data, we can appreciate some relation between
different variables. For instance, the wing length and the falling times seems
to be linearly correlated according to~\cref{fig_wl_times}. The same correlation
but this time less clear is present in~\cref{fig_al_times} with the arm length.
Finally, the arm and tail lengths might also be correlated as shown
in~\cref{fig_tl_al}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{../lab1/wing_length_vs_times.pgf}
  \caption{Correlation between the wing length (in centimeters) and the falling
  times (in seconds) of the two realizations.}
  \label{fig_wl_times}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{../lab1/arm_length_vs_times.pgf}
  \caption{Correlation between the arm length (in centimeters) and the falling
  times (in seconds) of the two realizations.}
  \label{fig_al_times}
\end{figure}

Despite of the described relations among the different variables, there are no
strong correlations among the variables of the model. Linear correlations are
just apparent but not clearly strong.

\paragraph{Linear regression.} A first model $m(X)$ was approximated by using a
linear regression. The basis functions were $\phi(x) = [1, x_0, x_0^2]$. Those
functions were based on effects on the wing length ($x_0$). However, the
coefficient of determination ($R^2$) for the obtained model was $0.237$. A
better model is obtained using the basis functions $\phi(x) = [1, x, x_3^2,
\sin(x_3), \cos(x_0)]$. $R^2$  for the new model is $0.778$ which (graphically)
fits better the data according to~\cref{fig_goodlr}.
\begin{figure}

  \input{../lab1/reg_beterr2.pgf}
  \caption{Linear regression based prediction.}
  \label{fig_goodlr}
\end{figure}

    \label{fig_badlr}
  \end{figure}
\end{comment}
Several functions were tried as basis. The ones with more effect are the
constant function ($1$), the linear effect on all the variables ($x$), the
cosine effect on the wing length ($\cos(x_0)$). However the other functions also
contribute to improve $R^2$.

\paragraph{P-values.} The contribution of the basis functions to the linear
regression are confirmed by the following vector of p-values: $\langle 0.0,
0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, .01, 0.01, 0.0 \rangle$ in summary there is a
high probability that all the basis functions contribute to the regression as
each value is close to $0.0$.

\paragraph{Influence of other physical quantities.}
In this point we are interested in the effect of other physical properties in
the experiment. Specifically, we were suggested to observe the angle between the
wing and the tail and additionally we computed the wing area and the wingspan
(distance between the farthest points of the two wings). \Cref{fig_newphysics}
presents the relation between those measures and the flying time. The figure
shows a clear linear trend between the angle and the flight time. Moreover, the
slope of that trend suggest the angle as a good candidate to optimize. The other
measures are not as promising. There is no clear trend in the wing area nor in
the wingspan.

  (in degrees) between wing and tail. Middle: area of the wing
  (in~\si{\centi\metre\squared}). Right: wingspan (in~\si{\centi\metre}). }

\end{figure}

\subsection{Gaussian process regression}

\paragraph{Kernel names.} In the first point we are presented a several kernel
implementations and asked to identify them. The first two implementations are
actually the same and both represent the \emph{Matern32} kernel. The third is
the implementation of the constant kernel. The fourth implementation is for the
\emph{Brownian} kernel. The last implementation corresponds to the
\emph{Gaussian} kernel.

\paragraph{Sampling from a Gaussian process and plots.}
The sampling function is completed by evaluating the provided kernel on the
input data. After that $n$ random samples are taken from a multivariate normal
with the provided mean ($\mu$) and the kernel as the covariance parameter.
\Cref{fig_gpsamples} presents samplings of the same kernel with different
parameters. The plot on the left uses $\theta=0.8$ which leads to a wider
``waves''.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{../lab1/gpsamples.pgf}
  \caption{Sample from a Gaussian process with kernel evaluated using the wing
  length of the helicopter. The kernel for the left sampling of five functions
  is \emph{Matern32} with $\sigma^2=1.0$ and $\theta=0.2$. The second plot is
  the same kernel, this time with only three functions and $\theta=0.8$}
  \label{fig_gpsamples}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Gaussian process regression for prediction of a toy function.} In
this point we are asked to approximate the function $f(x) = \sin(3\pi x)$
plotted in~\cref{fig_ftestsamples}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{../lab1/ftest.pgf}
  \caption{Plots for $f(x) = \sin(3\pi x)$ using $150$ (left) and $30$ (right)
  samples.}
  \label{fig_ftestsamples}
\end{figure}

The prediction was performed using the \emph{Matern32} kernel as it provided the
best results. The model and its variance are presented
in~\cref{fig_gppredftest}. $20$ points were predicted using the two trained
models. The quality of the predictions is measured by the sum of variances
between real and estimated values. The respective quantities were: $0.000132$
and $0.095207$ which let us conclude that the model trained with $150$ samples
is better than the one trained with just $30$. This is also appreciated in the
plots by looking at the variance. The light blue area is quite noticeable for
the second model.
