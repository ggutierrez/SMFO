\section{Lab session 1}

The are two parts in the first lab session. In the first part we were asked to
analyze the data corresponding to two realizations of the helicopter experiment.
\paragraph{Noise between realizations of the experiment.}

\Cref{fig_t1t2} shows the plot between the times of the experiments for every
realization. The average variance between the time of the experiments is
\SI{0.0425}{\second}. This indicates that there is not much noise present in the
data.

\paragraph{Relations in input data.}
According to the provided data, we can appreciate some relation between
different variables. For instance, the wing length and the falling times seems
to be linearly correlated according to~\cref{fig_wl_times}. The same correlation
but this time less clear is present in~\cref{fig_al_times} with the arm length.
Finally, the arm and tail lengths might also be correlated as shown
in~\cref{fig_tl_al}.

  times (in seconds) of the two realizations.}
  \label{fig_wl_times}
\end{figure}

  \input{lab1/arm_length_vs_times.pgf}
  \caption{Correlation between the arm length (in centimeters) and the falling
  times (in seconds) of the two realizations.}
  \label{fig_al_times}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Linear regression}
A first model $m(X)$ was approximated by using a linear regression. Hence $m(X)
= B(X)\bhat$. This gave the following results:
\begin{align*}
  covBeta = \input{../lab1/covBeta.tex} &  
  &\bhat = \input{../lab1/beta.tex}
\end{align*}
