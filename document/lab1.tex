\section{Lab session 1}

The are two parts in the first lab session. In the first part we were asked to
analyze the data corresponding to two realizations of the helicopter experiment.
\paragraph{Noise between realizations of the experiment.}

\Cref{fig_t1t2} shows the plot between the times of the experiments for every
realization. The average variance between the time of the experiments is
\SI{0.0425}{\second}. This indicates that there is not much noise present in the
data.

\paragraph{Relations in the input data.}
According to the provided data, we can appreciate some relation between
different variables. For instance, the wing length and the falling times seems
to be linearly correlated according to~\cref{fig_wl_times}. The same correlation
but this time less clear is present in~\cref{fig_al_times} with the arm length.
Finally, the arm and tail lengths might also be correlated as shown
in~\cref{fig_tl_al}.

  times (in seconds) of the two realizations.}

  \caption{Correlation between the arm length (in centimeters) and the falling
  times (in seconds) of the two realizations.}
  \label{fig_al_times}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Linear regression.} A first model $m(X)$ was approximated by using a
linear regression. The basis functions were $\phi(x) = [1, x_0, x_0^2]$. Those
functions were based on effects on the wing length ($x_0$). However, the $R^2$
for the obtained model was $0.237$. A better model is obtained by using the
basis functions $\phi(x) = [1, x, x_3^2, \sin(x_3), \cos(x_0)]$. With these
functions the $R^2$ statistic for the model is $0.778$ which (graphically) fits
better the data according to~\cref{fig_goodlr}.

  % In case there is some space at the end this is the plot of the first model
