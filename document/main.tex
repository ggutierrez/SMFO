\section{Introduction}
This is a report on the course \emph{Statistical Modelling for Optimization}
held at the \emph{Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira} from June 28th to July
1st. The practical part of course consisted of four lab sessions with a common
goal of optimizing the flying time of a paper helicopter model. In this document
we report our findings and caonclusions of the lab sessions.
