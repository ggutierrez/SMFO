\section{Introduction}
This is a report on the course \emph{Statistical Modelling for Optimization}
held at the \emph{Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira} from June 28th to July
1st. The practical part of course consisted of four lab sessions with a common
goal of optimizing the flying time of a paper helicopter model. In this document
we report our findings and caonclusions of the lab sessions.

\paragraph{Relations.}
According to the provided data, there seems to be a linear correlation between
the wing length and the falling times in the two realizations. This correlation
is plotted in~\cref{fig_wl_times}.

  times (in seconds) of the two realizations.}
